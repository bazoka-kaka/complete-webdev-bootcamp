DATABASES EXPLAINED SQL VS NOSQL 
================================

- databases are used to store datas 
in the internet 

- the main difference of a database:
sql or nosql 

- sql is the old one

- nosql - not only sql (not only structured 
query language) this can be of any formats
as long as it's not sql 

- the most famous sql:
mysql and postgresql

- the most famous nosql:
mongodb and redis

SQL (Structured Query Language) VS NOSQL 
----------------------------------------

a. structure 

- sql databases will group your datas 
into tables 

- sometimes sql databases could be 
extremely not flexible 
example:
you can't add something that is out of 
the table and you can't leave a data blank, 
or they'll be null which is bad and the 
source of error!

- mongodb on the other hand is on the JSON
format (key-value), meaning if you have
more data that is not in another data 
groupings, then it's not gonna affect them 
at all!

- none of the data in mongodb should have 
the same structure 

- if want something really flexible, then you 
should use the nosql databases 

b. relationships 

- sql is also called relational database 
while nosql is called non-relational database 

- sql database is really good at esablishing
relationships within your datas 

- sql groups datas into individual tables
and you can relate one table with another 

- nosql databases makes us rethink how 
we order our data:
1. embedded objects 
this is gonna cause data repetitions.
2. organizing your data in different documents
you can link them together, but a little 
clumsily: using references 
example:
you put another data's id inside 
your data that you wanna reference with it 

this is not quite efficient or fast 
as the sql one 

- if you need to store things like:
orders, customer details, products
inventory, things that have lots of 
relationships between one and another 
you should choose sql!

- but if you want a website that has 
one-to-many relationships
meaning when you have a user that generates
new contents: a one user to many posts 
for example then you should use the nosql 

c. scalability 

- the reason you wanna use nosql one of them is 
because of scalability 

- an excel spreadsheet, makes you 
become slower and slower until the computer 
gets an error 

- if you are running your sql database 
on your laptop, then you might just get 
more powerful computer and so on 

- managing a large amount of data 
using sql databases is like scaling a building
vertically the more you have data you add 
more into your building until it becomes
too high that it collapses, this is 
also really costly 

- different with sql, nosql uses distributed 
system in lots and lots of different computers
the datas are distributed amongst all of them 

general differences between sql and mongodb 
-------------------------------------------

mysql:
- more mature
- table structure 
- requires a schema (not easily changing)
- great with relationships 
- scales vertically (more infrastructure 
and more costly)

mongoDB:
- shiny and new 
- document structure 
- more flexible to changes 
- not great with complex relationships
- horizontally scalable
