CREATE TABLE AND INSERT DATA 
============================ 

- the best sql docs:
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/

- the 4 main things that you're gonna 
do with sql database:
a. create 
b. read 
c. update 
d. destroy 
(CRUD)

- this is where you can 
do sql online:

creating table 
--------------

CREATE TABLE products (
  id INT NOT NULL,
  name STRING,
  price MONEY,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

- primary key is something to uniquely 
identify your data with

- NOT NULL --> this is making your sql 
not allowing a data to be empty, this is 
usually used for the primary key 

inserting data into sql 
-----------------------

INSERT INTO products 
VALUES (1, "Pen", 1.20);

- if you don't wanna insert all of the values 
that is in the columns (only some of the datas)

INSERT INTO products (id, name)
VALUES (2, "Pencil");
