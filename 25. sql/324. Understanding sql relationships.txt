FOREIGN KEYS AND INNER JOIN 
===========================

- foreign key is the key that's gonna link 
all the tables together (making relationships
between tables)

- create a new table first (for demonstration 
purposes)

CREATE TABLE orders (
  id INT NOT NULL,
  order_number INT,
  customer_id INT,
  product_id INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products (id)
)

- populating the table orders 

INSERT INTO orders
VALUES (1, 4362, 2, 1);

INSERT INTO orders
VALUES (2, 3254, 1, 1);

- joining the table together 

there are lots of joins there, but 
the most commonly used is INNER JOIN 

example:
SELECT orders.order_number, customers.first_name, customers.last_name, customers.address
FROM orders 
INNER JOIN customers oN orders.customer_id = customers.id;

- challenge:
join the order with the product that the order 
is relating to 

answer:
SELECT orders.order_number, products.name, products.price, products.stock
FROM orders 
INNER JOIN products oN orders.product_id = products.id;
