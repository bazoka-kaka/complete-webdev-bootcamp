- javascript documentation:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript

useful javascript documentation:
https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js

note:
in a javascript or any programming project, you have to be so consistent
that even if lots of people are typing the code, 
it's like the one who types the code is just one person 

this docs is just to make sure that you use the right syntax 
and the right structure
