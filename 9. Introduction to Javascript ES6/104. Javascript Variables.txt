JAVASCRIPT VARIABLES 
====================

- to ask a user to enter something:
prompt("Enter something!");

- you can do this:
const name = prompt("Enter your name!");

note:
this is gonna save your name in name variable 

- keywords in javascript:
a. var 
b. let 
c. const 

note:
a keyword meaning that you are creating a new variable 

- if you reassign a new value to a var variable, 
you are gonna take that value and delete it, then you 
enter the value as your new value that you changed 
(the earlier is forever lost)

- to resassign a variable, you can do this:
variable = "a value";

(not using a keyword)
