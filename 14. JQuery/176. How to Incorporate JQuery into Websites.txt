HOW TO INCORPORATE JQUERY INTO WEBSITES
=======================================

- the most popular option is use the google's CDN

- the beauty of using a popular cdn:
if a user has been on another website
that uses the same cdn to fetch the jquery library
then they'll likely have it already cached
and saved in their browser meaning they won't have
to fetch a fresh copy of jquery

- this is the link:
https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/#jquery
use the 3x one!

- you have to put the jquery cdn just
above the javascript link!

example:
<body>
  <!-- your code -->
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="index.js"></script>
</body>

note:
if the link of jquery cdn is below your javascript link
then it'll not work!

this is because javascript doesn't know that 
jquery is linked yet!

also you can't put both the javascript and the jquery link
in the head section, it'll not work!

this is because:
before we try to loadup the jquery's library, index.js 
might actually be trying to access it

prevention:
checking whether the jquery is ready 

$document.ready(function() {
  $('h1').css('color', 'red');
})

here we're waiting for the jquery library has finished loading, 
then we do the jquery styling 

another way to do this is again do this:
<body>
<!-- your code -->
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="index.js"></script>
</body>

putting the libraries cdn in the end of your website
