MANIPULATING TEXT USING JQUERY 
==============================

- use .text() method 
example:
$("h1").text("Good Bye World!");

note:
since jquery is gonna select all of the elements 
that we specified for example:
$("button").text("Yehezkel is in Israel");

this is gonna change all of the buttons to the text 
"Yehezkel is in Israel"

(not just the first element)

- using .html 
using this, we're not just gonna be able to change the 
text but also add html element inside there!

example:
$("h1").html("<strong>You are handome!</strong>");

note:
this is making the text bold and the text is gonna be changed
to "You are handome!"

SOMETHING IMPORTANT 
-------------------

if you don't understand how vanilla javascript work, 
jquery will seem like a complete magic!

note:
most of developers are using jquery to write javascript!
instead of the javascript itself!
