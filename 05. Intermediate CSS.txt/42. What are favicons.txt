WHAT ARE FAVICONS
=================

sean's website:
https://web.archive.org/web/20180819202235js_/http://seanhalpin.io/

this is where you can create favicon:
https://www.favicon.cc/

to implement favicon you have to do this in your head of 
your html:

<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" />

if it doesn't work do this instead:
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico?v=2" />

note:
this is because your website have been downgraded to the previous
version or it's just trying to create a default one 
that it's placed there.
