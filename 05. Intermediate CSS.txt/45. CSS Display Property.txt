CSS DISPLAY PROPERTY
====================

- block elements: those that take up essentially the whole width 
of the screen on a webpage 
(blocking any elements from sitting next to it on the left 
or on the right side)

- common block elements:
a. paragraphs <p></p>
b. headers <h1></h1>
c. divisions <div></div>
d. lists and list items <ul></ul>, <ol></ol>, <li></li>
e. forms <form></form>

- inline elements: this only takes up as much space as it needs
to in the height and its width so you can see that 
the box around it is only as big as its content

- common inline elements:
a. spans <span></span>
b. images <img>
c. anchors <a></a>

- problem with inline element:
a. we can't change the width

- the thing with a block element:
a. we can change the width 

- to change the display property of an element: 
example:
p {
  display: inline;
}

note:
this makes the p (by default a block element) to become
an inline element 

or another example:
a {
  display: block;
}

note:
this makes the a (by default an inline element) to become
a block element 

- So the question is:
what should i do if i wanted elements that can occupy the same line
but at the same time, we could change its width?

answer: use something called inline-block 

- inline-block elements: elements that occupy the same line 
with another elements but we could change their widths

- images are like an inline-block element, because we're able 
to change its width and it sits on the same line with another 
elements

- here are display elements:
a. block 
element that is covering one entire line of the viewport by default, 
its width could be adjusted 
doesn't sit inline with another elements 

b. inline
element which container's size have the same size with its
content, its width can't be adjusted, 
sits inline with another elements 

c. inline-block
element which container's size is covering its own content by 
default, its width could be adjusted,
sits inline with another elements 

d. none
just gets rid of our element. this simply removes our element 
from the website as if it didn't exist. the element completely
disappears from the web, but not in our code 

- 2 ways to hide things from your website:
a. display: none 
this takes the element out of the flow as if it never existed

b. visibility: hidden
it makes the element disappear, but it keeps its original position 
and all the other elements still flow around it as if it's still 
there but it just can't be seen anymore 

here's the example: 
index.html:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Document</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css" />
</head>
<body>
  <p>block element</p>
  <a href='#'>inline element</a>
  <p class='inline-block-element'>inline block element</p>
</body>
</html>

styles.css:
p {
  background: red;
}

a {
  background: blue;
  color: white;
  text-decoration: none;
}

.inline-block-element {
  background: yellow;
  display: inline-block;
  width: 300px;
}
