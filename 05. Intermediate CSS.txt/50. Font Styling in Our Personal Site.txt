FONT STYLING 
============

serif --> has little feet at the end of the curves
sans-serif --> doesn't have little feet at the end of the curves 

- sometimes, operating systems can't read the websites 
correctly, therefore there's something called 
web safe fonts:
this means there's a set of font families where most operating 
systems will be able to render it correctly 

(this gives you the maximum chance of being rendered correctly)

this is the percentages of where you're

you can browse more fonts here:

for example you've added the font families:
you have to copy the 
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>

these are the font families that you wanna implement:
font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
font-family: 'Sacramento', cursive;
