FLOAT AND CLEAR
===============

FLOAT 
------

- making elements inline

example:
float: left;

note:
this makes the element in the left side of the 
entire part 

CLEAR 
------

- prevents from wrapping anything on the sides that you 
want to clear from 

example:
clear: left;

note:
float is the opposite of clear 

important notes
---------------

use float only when necessary
- float is only used to wrap text around a certain
element, and don't use it for positioning 

- instead use use relative or absolute units instead
of floats 

- remember: leave float for the cases of wrapping texts
only
