CSS SIZING
==========

font-size for example:
font-size: 90px;

note:
this is not a dynamic size, for example if you zoom out your 
website, you're not gonna see your website font-size 
appear bigger 

this is because you are using px for the size 

solution:
we can use something like a percentage:

if it's 100% size:
the size is actually 16px 

meaning if you want 90px

you have to do this:
90/16 = 562.5%

this is how you implement it:
font-size: 562.5%;

another way:
- using em:
-----------

1em is 16px

16px = 100%

therefore 16px =  100% = 1em

here's how you could count the em:

if you want 90px converted to em:

90/16 = 562.5%

therefore since 
1em = 100%

you have to do this:
90px = 562.5%/100em = 5.625em

implementation:
font-size: 5.625em;

- distinction between statically and dynamically sized 
fonts:

when you're using dynamically sized fonts, that value 
is inherited 

example:
body {
  font-size: 2em;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 5.625em;
}

this is gonna make the font-size in h1 much larger
than before when the font-size is not specified in
the body 

another dynamically sized sizing:
rem:
----

rem means: ignore all the parent settings for the font-size 
and just set it relative to the root 

THE BEST WAY TO SIZE A TEXT:
JUST USE REM!!!

note:
remember the number: 1 rem = 100% = 16px 

if you want 90px --> 90/16 = 5.625rem

challenge: in the title:  change the p to h2 then 
set the font size to rem equals to 40px 
40/16 = 2.5rem
