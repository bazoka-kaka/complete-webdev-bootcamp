WHY DO WE NEED APIs 
===================

- you can use all sorts of data from using 
APIs and you can use them in your own website 

- definition of API:
An Application Programming Interface(API) is a set of 
commands, functions, protocols, and objects 
that programmers can use to create software 
or interact with an external system 

- how websites tell which datas that you can access from 
them and how to do that?
example:
if it's a restaurant website, it's in the form of a menu 
if it's a weather api, it's temperatures, weather condition,
weather image, pressure 

example of an api:
jquery
