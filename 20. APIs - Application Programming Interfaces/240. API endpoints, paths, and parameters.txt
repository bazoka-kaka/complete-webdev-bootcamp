API ENDPOINTS, PATHS, AND PARAMETERS 
====================================

4 things about API:
a. endpoint
b. paths 
c. parameters 
d. authentication

a. endpoint 
every API that interacts with an external system 
like a server, will have an endpoint 

b. paths 
this is like in the specification of your url 
example: 
something/jokes/programming 
this is gonna be programming jokes 
something/jokes/military 
this is gonna be military jokes

c. parameters
parameters go to the end of your url after a question mark 
example:
something/joke/programming?contains=debugging 
note:
the parameter here is "debugging"
the key is called "contains" 
and the query is "debugging"
if we have more than one query:
something/joke/programming?contains=debugging&contains=debugging&blacklistFlags=nsfw
you are gonna use "&"
note:
b and c are parameters to narrow down on a specific 
piece of data you want from an external server.

challenge:
you want a joke that contains the word "arrays"
or if you want what categories are available 
from the joke api
