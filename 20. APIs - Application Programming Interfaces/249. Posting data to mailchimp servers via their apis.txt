POSTING DATA TO MAILCHIMP SERVERS VIA THEIR APIS 
================================================ 

- you first have to register to 
mailchimp then you have to create 
your api key 

note:
this is mine:
8886c3bf5853603add085afb657679e0-us20

- go here:
mailchimp.com/developer/reference 

then you can use this to figure out how you can 
add subscribers to our list 

go to the list/audiences section

we're interested in the POST /list/{list_id}
part because we wanna subscribe some 
list members 

the process is the same whether you wanna 
batch subscribe lots of people or 
subscribe a single person 

all you need is a list id, and you can 
provide the members you wanna subscribe 
in the body of your request 

- getting our list id:
in the mailchimp.com dashboard 
go to audience --> manage audience --> 
settings --> scroll down and get your 
unique id 

note:
this is your audience id or your list id 

this is gonna help mailchip identify the list 
that you want to put your subscribers into 

copy that and paste then comment
at the bottom of your app.js file 

- start sending our request to mailchimp:

to add request to the api:
use https.request()
