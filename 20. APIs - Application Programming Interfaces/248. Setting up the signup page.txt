SETTING UP THE SIGNUP PAGE 
========================== 

1. cd where you wanna make 
your folder 
2. create new project folder 
called Newsletter-Signup
3. create a 
new app.js file, signup.html file, 
success.html file, and a failure.html file 
4. initialize npm with default options 
5. install body-parser, express, and 
request npm modules to the new project 
6. require the newly installed modules 
in app.js file 
7. create a new express app and set it 
to listen on port 3000 
8. once port is setup, log 
"server is running on port 3000"

note:
you can install modules all at the same time:
> npm i express body-parser request 

- boostrap sign in:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/sign-in/

note: this is what we're gonna use 

right click on it then view source 
then copy all of it and copy it in our signup.html 

- challenge:
setup the get method for our home route 
to the signup page so that we can 
test it on the browser at localhost 3000 

note:
something is not quite right:
our image is gone and our css is also gone 

because the styles.css and our image is a static file!

in order for our server to serve static files 
we need to use a special function of express 
which is called static 

we have to do this:
in our app.js:
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const request = require("request");

const app = express();

//you have to define a static folder called public here
app.use(express.static("public"));

app.get("/", function (req, res) {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + "/signup.html");
});

app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log("server is running at port 3000");
});

after that you have to create a folder called 
"public" and inside there create another folder 
called "css" then put your styles.css there 

then in signup.html:
you have to reference your styles.css file like 
this:
<link href="css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />

- another challenge:
programming the post routes:
we're gonna use body parser to grab the data 
from the signup form and we're gonna console.log 
it from our server. 

hint:
you will need to change the code in the html 
form on the signup.html page
