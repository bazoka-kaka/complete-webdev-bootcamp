WHAT IS JSON 
============ 

- JSON = Javascript Object Notation 
- the reason why we use JSON to pass data around 
the internet:
it's in a format that is human readable but it can 
also be easily collapsed down to take up as little 
space as possible 

- json is not the only format that we can 
receive data from apis 

another format is like xml, which is extensive markup language,
or html, hypertext markup language 

but json is the most favourite one because it's the most 
lightweight and is real easy to turnup back to javascript 
object 

- if you wanna turn a raw json into a pretty version, 
you can download a chrome extension:
