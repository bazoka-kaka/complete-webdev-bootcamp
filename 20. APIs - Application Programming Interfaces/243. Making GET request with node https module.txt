MAKING GET REQUEST WITH NODE HTTPS MODULE 
=========================================

- create a file called index.html and app.js 
- npm init 
- npm i express 

- to get request from another website:
search google:
make get request from external server with node 

you can do it in 5 ways:
a. using the standard node library 
(https module)
b. request module 
c. axios 
d. superAgent 
e. got 

note:
all of these last four are external npm packages 

but we're gonna do the native one 

final code in app.js:
const express = require("express");
const https = require("https");

const app = express();

app.get("/", function (req, res) {
  const url =
    "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London,uk&appid={your token key}&units=metric";
  https.get(url, function (res) {
    console.log(res);
  });
  res.send("Server is up and running");
});

app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log("server is running on port 3000");
});


note:
you have to use the https:// thing because our program 
doesn't have automation to add the https:// stuff 
like in the regular browser
