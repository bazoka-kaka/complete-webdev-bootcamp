RUNNING CODE INSIDE EJS TEMPLATE 
================================ 

- we wanna check if the day is a 
weekday or a weekend
then change the color accordingly 

- if we wanna add some logics to our 
.ejs file, we're gonna have to use this:
<% for our javascript variable tag 
within our control flow 

docs:
https://ejs.co/#docs

"<% 'Scriptlet' tag, for control-flow, no output"

this is called scriptlet because we're not 
able to write full javascript here 

but we can use control flows such as if, switch, 
else, else if, while, etc statements here 

this is gonna allow you to render different html 
depending on what was the value of the variable 
that you got passed in to the template 

you have to add it around any part of your code 
that is not html 

final code in list.ejs:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>To Do List</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <% if(kindOfDay == 'Saturday' || kindOfDay == 'Sunday') { %>
    <h1 style="color: purple">It's a <%= kindOfDay %>!</h1>
    <% } else { %>
    <h1 style="color: blue">It's a <%= kindOfDay %>!</h1>
    <% } %>
  </body>
</html>

- the scriptlet tag allow you to do 
basic javascript which is the control flow 
so you can render our html slightly differently 
depending on the value of the variable 
that got passed in
