CSS LINK ORDER
--------------

- if you have overlapping styles in 
your css linking, the one that is gonna be applied 
is the one that is the last linked 

example:
in your styles1.css:
h1 {
  color: blue;
}

in your styles2.css:
h1 {
  color: red;
}

in your index.html:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles2.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles1.css">

the one that is gonna be applied is the styles1 
meaning the h1 is gonna have the color of blue 

- according to the last statement, if you reference
your styles.css before your boostrap cdn link, 
you are not gonna see any difference sometimes, 
since the boostrap has already defined it

if you want to make your styles.css take an effect, 
you have to place it after your bootstrap cdn link:

<link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">

VERY IMPORTANT
--------------

Unlike CSS and JavaScript, HTML code is executed from 
top to bottom so the order of your code matters.
