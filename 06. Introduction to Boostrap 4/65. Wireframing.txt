WIREFRAMING
===========

what the workflow of a web designer might look like 

one of the first things that you have to do as a web designer
before touching the code or designing etc:
- wireframing

wireframes = low fidelity representation of your design 

note:
you might wanna sketch out and discuss the low quality 
representation of your website before designing it better 

like building a home (you're architecturing it)

you might be creating one version using wireframing, see if other 
people like it, essentially you wanna settle for a design 
before you go ahead and implement it 

it's supposed to look really really simple, and doesn't take 
so much time at all 

the opposite of this:

- mock up 
high-fidelity representation of your app or your web's design 

this is like using the figma 

you want the actual representation of your website looks like 
your mockup 

problem:
if it's not the first thing you start messing around with, 
you're gonna end up stuck on choosing the colors, icons, 
images, etc 

- the classic workflow:
a. see other people's websites
this will give you the idea about the layout, structure, etc 
here's websites to see other people's website (their portofolios
to get an idea of how your website should look like)

b. looking up for ui patterns

note:
here you can look for the problems you're trying to solve
as you're designing your website 

example:
you need to create a carousel, then it'll give you an example 
from great websites 

this is for understanding how other people solved problem 
using their designs 

c. create a simple sketch wireframe 
for planning the layouts and how everything is going to be 

d. create a mockup 
you can use photoshop or illustrator or figma to see 
the photo realistic versions of your future websites 

e. create a prototype 
this is an animated version of your website to show
off what it's gonna be looking like

really cool thing about dribbble: 
you can search dribbble by colors 
(you can specify a tone that you quite like)
