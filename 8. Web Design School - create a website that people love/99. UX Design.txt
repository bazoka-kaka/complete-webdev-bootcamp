USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN 
======================

- what is User Experience:
design is something that we think of like 
having an aesthetic what we think looks good 
and enforcing that on the user 


good experience with a website meaning 
unobtrusive, it just lets you do your thing 
and it feels like as if everything is easy 
and everything is effortless 

1. SIMPLICITY 
-------------

- keeping things simple is always better than 
making it complex or more cluttered

- making color schemes consistent and typography 
is really delightful to read rather than complicated
things that hurts your eyes with design 
(meaning nicer user experience!)

2. CONSISTENCY 
--------------

- keep your design consistent 

but 

also keep the functionality of your product 
consistent 

- don't make the user confused from going 
to parts of your website because of inconsistency!

3. READING PATTERNS
-------------------

- one of the most common reading pattern:
F Pattern, Z Pattern

- F Pattern meaning:
eyes start at the top left of the corner 
to the right then down and so on 

- so you have things like bullet points, pictures, 
icons, etc they are all on the left 

- Z Pattern meaning:
left to right, then zigzaging around to the left
then right again

example of the usage: websites with videos 
or things like the facebook website 

5. ALL PLATFORM DESIGN 
----------------------

- mobile responsiveness is really important 

- don't make your web too cramped out with 
things that make you dizzy 

- don't make your website too concentrated
also that makes your user not having 
anything until they scroll to the end 

- use your family and friends, professional testers 
and get feedbacks, you have to test, test, test

6. DON'T USE YOUR POWERS FOR EVIL 
---------------------------------

- some designers use their knowledge about user 
interface, design, and user experience 
also psychology to do bad things
(this is called dark patterns)
