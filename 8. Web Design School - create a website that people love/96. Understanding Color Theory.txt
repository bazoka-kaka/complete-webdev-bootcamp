UNDERSTANDING COLOR THEORY 
==========================

- you have to be aware of the mood of your 
color palette 
example:
a treehouse - green 
a diving lesson - blue 

1. RED 
love, energy, intensity 
example: red car that is making you feel energetic

2. YELLOW 
joy, intellect, attention 
example: beachboy

3. GREEN 
freshness, safety, growth 
example: usually grocery stores use this color

4. BLUE 
stability, trust, serenity 
example: financial companies like paypal, or 
cryptocurrency
note: if you use blue shirts, people are gonna trust you 
more!

5. PURPLE 
royalty, wealth, feminimity 
example: payday loan that is targeted to women 

IMPORTANT
---------

it's not about that you like the color, but 
it's about what you're trying to convey 
as message to the user!

COMBINING COLORS 
----------------

- usually designers are gonna look for scientific
ways of designing colors 
example:
analogous color palette - colors that are 
right at each other 
note:
this is real harmonious and work together 
(good for navigation bars, body of your website, 
things like logo, and its background)

it's not good for standing up tough!

complementary color palette - colors that are opposite 
from each other 
note:
this make things pop up 
()
example: meat that are placed with fake green 
plants to make it more fresh

not good:
styling text and text background that are opposite 
of colors because it looks very jarring 
don't do this concerning texts
good:
make things like logos or things that really2 stands 
out to be created using complementary colors 

good website for coloring:
