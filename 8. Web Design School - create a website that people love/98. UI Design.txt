USER INTERFACE DESIGN 
=====================

- you have to convey the most important things 
by making the fonts that you want appear larger, 
bolder, more contrasting color, or something like that 

COLOR 
-----

- colors that really stands out and pops out and 
have contrast with the background tend to be 
used for high hierarchy 

example:
if your predominant colors are grey and white, 
then you're gonna have to use another bright color 
like green and red to the complete the purchase 
or the current tab they are in 

SIZE 
----

- bigger items often draw your eyes to it 

LAYOUT 
------

- different sizes and shapes also different hierarchies 
make your design looks more interesting 

example of a bad design:
wikipedia

- too long and it gets too tedious to read 
- to short and it get a bit choppy and awkward 
to read 

- THE IDEAL CHARACTERS IN A LINE:
40 - 60 characters per line 

- good layout example:
gramarly website 

ALIGNMENT 
---------

- how you position your element relative 
to one another 

- one of the easiest ways of making any sort of design 
you create look professional:

REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ALIGNMENT POINTS!

- the less alignment points the more the design 
looks coherent: more professional 

- tips:
use gridlines to visualize where the starting points
of each element

WHITE SPACE 
-----------

- empty spaces around your text or your elements 

- lots of luxury stores, their best works are just 
injecting white spaces around their products!

- spacing things out! make lots more expensive

- if you have lots of things like ditched up, 
it makes it like a discount show!

- if you have things like in your digital design:
new, 100% noise cancellation, only $20, ...
it makes the product looks cheap 
but if you make more whitespace to it, it looks 
like apple made 

AUDIENCE (THE MOST IMPORTANT) 
-----------------------------

- think about your audience and what may appeal to them!

- you have to have more flexibility in your 
design not just according to the rules, but 
about the audience or the message you're trying 
to convey
