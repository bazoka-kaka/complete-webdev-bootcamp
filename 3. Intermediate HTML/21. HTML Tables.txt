HTML TABLES
===========

when you see at the documentation, there are lots of attributes that 
you can assign to the table element, but it's all been 
deprecated meaning it's no longer recommended that you use them 
(it's downgraded)

this is because we have to remember that html is for structures,
css is for styling, and javascript is for the functionality of
your program

note:
<tr></tr> --> this is your table row (if you create one you're gonna be having
one single row)

<td></td> --> this is your table data that's inside of your rows (<tr></tr>)

there're nothing called table columns, this means there are no elements
that are in the functionality of a table column, you're only gonna be able
to do something with the table rows
<th></th> --> this is for your table heading for each column
<td></td> --> this is for your table data

this is your final table code:

<table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Dates</th>
          <th>Work</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>2019</td>
        <td>Complete HighSchool</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2021</td>
        <td>Learn Web Programming</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
