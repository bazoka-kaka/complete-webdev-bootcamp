HOW TO STRUCTURE TEXT IN HTML 
=============================

<i></i> and <em></em> these two are catalicizing text, but there's
difference between it:
em contains an information that the text should be emphesized
so that it's got more important meaning than the rest of the text, 

another thing is this:
instead of using <b></b> you should use <strong></strong>
to give meaning that the text should be highlighted instead
of just making the text darker 

this is the final code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <title>Yehezkel's Personal Site</title>
</head>
