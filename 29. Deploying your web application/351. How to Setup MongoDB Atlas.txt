351. How to Setup MongoDB Atlas
===============================

- here we're gonna connect with the mongoshell 

to see your mongo version:
> mongo --version 

then you connect by copying the 
command to your command shell 

- to see if we're connected to the same cluster:
click collections, create a new database 
call it "test" collection name also "test"

and you wanna create a new data:
newData: "Welcome to your database" 

then you can do something just like 
the usual mongodb databases 

- connecting it from our application 

now in your database, select 
"connect your application"

the copy the url example:
mongodb+srv://tsukikagemaikaka1:Tsukikagemaika1@cluster0.ukhyx.mongodb.net/todolistDB

you have to change your password with 
our admin password 

you have to add your database 
name in the end of this link:
example
.../todolistDB 

you have to delete this too:
myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority

that's it.. you're now using the database 
from the atlas!
