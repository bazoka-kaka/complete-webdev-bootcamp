350. How to Deploy Web Apps with a Database
===========================================

- if we deploy our website to an internet 
server, then we wanna connect that server 
with our local database, then 
it's not gonna work!

- few differences between a server and a work station:
server:
has to be online 24/7

we have to move our database to a server 
so that it can be served 24/7 
and accross the internet 

here we're gonna use atlas 

note:
this is gonna allow us to have a database address 
in the internet 

example:
mongodb://cluster0.mongodb.net:27017 

this is gonna host your database and serve 
up your data whenever it's needed
