RETRIEVAL IS HOW YOU LEARN 
==========================

- if you're just following along, it's easy to think
it's easy and we understand it 
but doing something yourself, you're using completely 
different skills 

- you have to constantly retrieving (pulling out) of informations 
out of your brain (lookup excercizes out in the internet)

- do it yourself first, then continue to the tutorials
