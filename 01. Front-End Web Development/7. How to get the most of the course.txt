HOW TO GET THE MOST OF THE COURSE
=================================

each lesson is 10 minutes long

- don't type along!, you have to understand what the code is doing 
after understanding it and what the tutorial is trying to teach you
then go to your computer, and try to replicate what's going on 
(this makes you understand your codes better)

you could speed up your typing speed using some websites like:
https://www.keybr.com

- by doing this, you're gonna be able to learn better, you're gonna be able to absorb the content
much better then you test yourself to see if you totally understand it or not

(don't code along but learn it first, then try to replicate without seeing until you're stuck)

--> 10 minutes interval

- WHILE you're watching the video, you should take notes to review in the future
this is totally useful after the 10 minutes are up and try to remember what the codes were
and what the theories that was covered this is the cornel method:
1. topic/title
2. notes
3. keywords/questions (this is what you're gonna research later also hints and reminders)
4. summary (in a view bullet points)

- if you already know most of the concept, you just fast forward, but the opposite, just
slow it down

- DON'T SKIP! never skip any of the tutorials or the modules except for the skippable parts
which are those that are not really important

- IF it becomes real hard that you can't solve it, just bookmark it, making a note on which module
we're really struggling with and try to use the earlier method of watching the videos 

IF it's real hard and you can't do it, that is something that you have to come back to later 
maybe it's just weeks maybe months maybe days whatever just do that later!

- YOU HAVE TO PERSEVERE AND PUT YOUR HOURS INTO THAT 
PRACTICE = MASTERY 

- STUCK?
MOST OF THE PROGRAMMERS SPEND 90% OF THEIR TIME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT 
WHAT IS WRONG, WHAT IS IT NOT WORKING (GETTING STUCK IS A VERY UNIVERSAL PART OF PROGRAMMING);
SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO LOVE AND ENJOY

IF YOU'RE STUCK, YOU JUST HAVE TO SEARCH GOOGLE AND STACK OVERFLOW

- STRUGGLING IS GOOD
