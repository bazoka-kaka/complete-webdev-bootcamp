HOW WEBSITES WORK
=================

- what HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT do?
- to access a website, we need a browser (internet explorer, chrome, safari, firefox, etc) that can
render the website so it's human readable
- usually the website that you received from the server consists of these three types of files:
html, css, and javascript files

html --> this is your website structure
css --> this is your website styles
javascript --> this is what allows your website to do things
