HOW TO GET HELP WHEN YOU'RE STUCK
=================================

- when you're stuck, think of it like a challenge that if you solve it
you get the best feelings in the world 

how to get yourself unstuck:
1. have an understanding of what the reality vs the expectation is 
what did your code expect to happen vs what actually happen 
then understand what is causing the difference 

tip: copy the error from your console to google so that you could understand
the meaning

the best website: stack overflow 

2. rewatch the video from the beginning till where your code starts breaking 
and check it thoroughly

3. check the code 

4. the qna (this is the final move)

ask in the qna:
1. what did you expect
2. what actually happened
3. screenshot your code 
4. screenshot of the debug console 

to take a screenshot in window:
window + shift + s
