HOW DOES THE INTERNET WORK
==========================

- internet is just a long wire that attaches lots of computer, 
some of the computer have to be 24/7 so that other computers
could access it. this is called a server 

- any computer that a user uses to access the internet is called 
a client

how the internet works:
client sends message to internet service provider (ISP) --> ISP will relay that message
that you sent to DNS server (Domain Name System server) --> DNS finds IP address --> send it back to the
client via ISP --> client sends that IP address to the ISP --> ISP deliver it to the server which has the IP address 
through the literal backbone of the internet (which is a huge cable accross the seas) --> the server then is going to give
the response of which you are requesting to them to the client (to you)

internet service providers(ISPs):
US: AT&T or comcast
UK: BT or talktalk

DNS (Domain Name System) --> this is just like a huge phone book that if we do some request it'll search in its
database on what is the ip address of the website that you're requesting

note:
every single computer that is connected to the internet has an IP address (IP addres is like your postal code in your computer)
