DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS 
==========================================

- creating an object factory:
function BellBoy(name, age, hasWorkPermit, languages) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.hasWorkPermit = true;
  this.languages = languages;
}

note:
this is called a constructor function 

the unique thing about this is that it has to be 
a capital letter for the first one!

- initializing a constructor:
example:
let bellBoy1 = new BellBoy("Timmy", 20, true, ["japanese", "german"]);

- full example:
function HouseKeeper(yearsOfExp, name, cleaningRepetoire) {
    this.yearsOfExp = yearsOfExp;
    this.name = name;
    this.cleaningRepetoire = cleaningRepetoire;
}

let houseKeeper1 = new HouseKeeper(12, "Jane", ["Bathroom", "Bedroom"]);

console.log(houseKeeper1);
