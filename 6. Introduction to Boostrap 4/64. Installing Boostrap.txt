INSTALLING BOOSTRAP 
===================

- the simplest way:
just copy the boostrap cdn:
from:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T" crossorigin="anonymous">

- cdn = content delivery network
note:
content delivery network is just a whole bunch of points
in the world (not in the actual root server) where
you can access your websites from.
in indonesia, it's jakarta

- another way to add boostrap:
just copy and use their starter template
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/#template


- the third way of using bootstrap:
downloading the css and js code:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/#download

note:
this is slow because since it's a local file in your website, 
the browser won't recognize this and will not know that it's
already been downloaded (most computers already downloaded boostrap)
and already been cached so it'll have to download all of the css 
boostrap files in your website to load up (which takes more time 
than it's supposed to be)

throughout this course, we're just gonna use the first
method which is using the cdn link 

note:
for some components in javascript to work, they actually 
need some javascript
