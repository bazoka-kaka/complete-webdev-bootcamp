TIPS (THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ON A WEBSITE)
----
the most important thing:
whenever you are designing a website, you have to think 
about what is the first thing you want the user to look 
at 

you wanna establish like the visual hierarchy 

you can do that using size, weight, highlighting, 
etc 

then the second most important thing:
THEM TO START TAKING ACTION (the download button for
example)

the third most important thing:
WHAT OUR COMPANY IS 
and things they can explore 
------------------------------------------------------

- challenge 1:
change all of the fonts to montserrat

solution:
styles.css:
body {
  font-family: "Montserrat";
}

note:
don't forget the semicolon!

- challenge 2:
change the title text to have white color 

first solution:

h1 {
  font-size: 3rem;
  font-family: montserrat;
  line-height: 1.5;
  font-weight: 700;
  color: white;
}

another solution:
#title {
  background-color: #ff4c68;
  color: white;
}

challenge 3:
change the navbar brand to:
font-family: ubuntu 
font-size: 2.5 
font-weight: bold

solution: 
/* Navigation Bar */
.navbar-brand {
  font-family: "Ubuntu";
  font-size: 2.5rem;
  font-weight: bold;
}

challenge4 :
change the bottom padding of the navbar to 4.5rem

solution: 
.navbar {
  padding-bottom: 4.5rem;
}

challenge 5:
add space in the nav-items using the padding spacing, 
and add it as 18 px each and make it larger also
change the font-family to montserrat-light
so that it's not so prominent on the page 

solution: 
.nav-item {
  padding: 0 18px;
}

.nav-link {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  font-family: "Montserrat";
}


note:
in the nav-item we're using absolute sizing because if 
we're gonna make our sites responsive, we're gonna 
have to make this not change 


- change the padding of the navbar-nav so that 
it doesn't have padding on the left and right 
solution:

.navbar {
  padding: 0 0 4.5rem;
}

TIPS
----

when you are designing websites, apps, or whatever, 
try to minimize on the number of lines that you 
can align things to 

because it'll usually make your design look together 

- challenge 5:
add margin to the button so that it doesn't get too close 
with the text

solution:
.download-btn {
  margin: 5% 3% 5% 0;
}

note:
in order to target the button, we have 2 options:
1. use the bootstrap btn class, and customize
the bootstrap styles
2. add in our custom class 

in this situation if you start being lazy 
and using classes provided in the bootstrap, 
you are gonna be in the situation when you 
are gonna use the btn class, therefore 
it's better to use a custom class instead
of customizing the classes already provided 
in the bootstrap 

since we wanna the size relative to the viewport, 
here we're using the relative sizing 

remember to add the class in your button in html  


- challenge 6:
make the image 60% of the parent's size 

solution: 
.title-image {
  width: 60%;
}


note:
again we are using the relative sizing since 
we want our image size to be relative to the viewport 

- challenge 7:
making the image rotating 

solution: 
.title-image {
  width: 60%;
  transform: rotate(25deg);
}
