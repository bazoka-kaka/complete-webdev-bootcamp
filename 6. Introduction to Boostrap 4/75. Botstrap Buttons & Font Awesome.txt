FONT AWESOME
------------

https://fontawesome.com/

- font awesome is what gives you an icon text 

- now go to font-awesome then go to icons 

https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&p=2

- to use it just click on "start using this icon" 
then copy the copiable part
example:
<i class="fab fa-apple"></i>

note:
here you have fab which is (font awesome button)
then fa-apple which is the icon of the apple 

- before using it, you need to embed it 

- first go to font awesome --> get-started 
then copy the cdn 

note:
first you need to login using your email 

here's the kit for example:

<script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/59216d21ed.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

note:
you can comment out things like this:
1. type the comment
2. on the comment: ctrl + /

- ITALIC TAG ON FONT AWESOME:
font awesome likes to use the <i></i> thing 
which is not that great in terms of HTML best
practice, but the reason is:
glyphs and icons are not italicized therefore 
it doesn't become slanted 
another reason:
the i tag is the shortest tag that can be used 
for this purpose 

note:
you can use the i tag just like that, or if you want 
a more semantically understandable css code, you 
can use the <span></span> also 

example:
<span class="fab fa-apple"></span>

challenge:
implement the btn-outline-light icon using the  
google play icon!

solution:
<button class="btn btn-outline-light btn-lg" type="button">
              <span class="fab fa-google-play"></span> Download
            </button>
