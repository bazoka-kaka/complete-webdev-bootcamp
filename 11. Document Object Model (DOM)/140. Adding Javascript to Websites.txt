ADDING JAVASCRIPT TO WEBSITES
=============================

- inline javascript:
<body onload='alert("Hello")'></body>

note:
here means whenever the body is loaded, our javascript 
is also going to be loaded up with it 

the quotation marks are confusing 

we have to put it in another place!

- internal javascript 
  <body>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      alert("Hello");
    </script>
  </body>

- external javascript:
index.html:
  <body>
    <script src="index.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  </body>

index.js:
alert("Hello");

- you have to put the styling link in the first this is why:
index.htMl:
  <body>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <script src="index.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css" />
  </body>

index.js:
alert("Hello");

styles.css:
h1 {
  color: red;
  background-color: black;
}

note:
this will alert "Hello" first while the styling is still 
in the default (black color and white body background color)

then after we press okay, the style is just implemented
(late)

- why javascript is in the end?
so that the page loads first! (to make more sense of it!)
then the javascript

another thing is that,
javascript can't load things that haven't existed 
example:
your dom wanna change the h1, if it didn't find it, 
it'll never be implemented at all!

example:
index.html:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css" />
    <script src="index.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    <title>JAVASCRIPT DOM</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
  </body>
</html>

index.js:
document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML = "GoodBye!";


note:
the index.js will never be implemented!

you have to put your .js file in the end of your body element
