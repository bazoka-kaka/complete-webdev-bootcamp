20 MINUTES METHODS
==================

- you have to be consistent of doing something!

- you should do this:
im gonna do this thing just for 20 minutes, 
after that im going to be a free person doing anything 
that i want, but the thing is that the momentum of you 
doing it is always gonna be going!

- there's innertia of doing and innertia of stopping 
which one will you choose?
