INTRODUCTION TO DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL 
=====================================

- to change parts of the website on the fly 
(to make our website interactable)

- DOM catalogues the web page into individual object 
that we can select and manipulate

- the task of converting an html file into DOM is done 
by the browser when you load up your web page 
(it turns the html into a tree structure - making its 
relationships with each other)

example:
title is descendant of head tag 
but the head and the body are siblings 

- everything that is inside your HTML document 
is contained in an object called the document 
(the tree structure of DOM)

- install the following:
HTML tree generator 
note:
this is gonna show what the tree of a page's html

- navigating through the tree:
in the js console in your browser:
document;

note:
this is the entire html file 

document.firstElementChild;

note:
this is navigating through the first child 
in the tree 


document.firstElementChild.firstElementChild

note:
this is navigating through the first child of 
the first child in the tree 

document.lastElementChild;

note:
this is gonna output everything that is inside the body 

- after you successfully selected the object 
that you're interested in inside the DOM, then 
you can manipulate it 

- manipulating the h1:
let heading = document.firstElementChild.firstElementChild.firstElementChild;
heading.innerHTML = "Good Bye!";

- to manipulate the content of an html element:
htmlElement.innerHTML = "something";
example:
heading.innerHTML = "Good Bye!";

- to manipulate the style of an html element:
htmlElement.style.style = "something";
example:
htmlElement.style.color = "red";

- selecting elements and make it do things 
example:
to select our input (the checkbox):
document.querySelector("input").click();

note:
document.querySelector("input") --> this is looking through 
the entire document for the object that has  
selector of "input"

the .click() meaning that it'll click on the input 
selector

the code above is gonna click the checkbox making it 
as selected 

- our objects inside the DOM can have:
1. properties
describes something about the object 
example of a property:
text color, width, height, etc 

2. methods
things that an object can do 
example:
break(), drive(), park(), etc 


GET PROPERTY 
-------------

example:
car.color; //red 

SET PROPERTY 
------------

example:
car.numbersOfDoors = 0;

CALL METHOD 
-----------

example:
car.drive();

note:
difference between method and function
a method is something that an object can do 
(it has to be associated with an object)
while a function doesn't get associated 
with an object 

DOM EXAMPLES OF PROPERTIES AND METHODS
--------------------------------------

properties:
a. innerHTML
b. style 
c. firstChild 

methods:
a. click()
b. appendChild() 
c. setAttribute()

challenge
---------

in the resources, we've got the file of the challenge 
1. select the third li 
2. change the word "Third" to your name 
note:
don't touch the file, you have to do it through the console!

solution:
let lastLi = document.querySelector("ul").lastElementChild;
lastLi.innerHTML = "Yehezkel Wiradhika"

another solution:
document.firstElementChild.lastElementChild.lastElementChild.lastElementChild.innerHTML = "Angela"
