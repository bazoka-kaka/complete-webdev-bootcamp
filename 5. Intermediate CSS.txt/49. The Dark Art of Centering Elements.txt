THE DARK ART OF CENTERING ELEMENTS WITH CSS 
===========================================

if we wanna center all of our elements, do this 
in the parent element such as the body element:

text-align: center;

this works as long as:
1. if we've got an inline block element 
2. we've got this full width block elements

note:
this is not gonna work on block element with the width of less
than 100%

another way of centering an element:
using the margin 

here's an example:

h1 {
  display: block; /* the display is block */
  width: 10%; /*the width is not full */
  margin: 0 auto 0 auto; /* centered using margin */
}

note:
------------------------------------------------------------------
you can also do the following:
h1 {
  margin: 0 auto;
}

the first arg is the vertical one and the second one is horizontal
------------------------------------------------------------------

we can do this to the block element that has a width that is not 
100%

margin: 0 auto 0 auto;

the shorter one is this:
margin: 0 auto;

note:
the 0 is for top and bottom margin 
the auto is for left and right margin 

3 types of margin: 
a. one value:
margin: 1px; --> on all four sides

b. two values:
margin: 1px 1px; --> first: top and bottom, second: left and right 

c. three values:
margin: 1px 2px 1px; --> first: top, second: left and right, third: bottom 

d. four values:
margin: 1px 2px 1px 2px; --> first: top, second: right, third: bottom, fourth: left 

POSITIONING AN ABSOLUTE ELEMENT TO SOMETHING
--------------------------------------------

- to position an absolutely positioned element relative to something, 
one of its parent has to have its position as relative 
if not, then it'll position itself relative to the body element 

- example:
<div class='blue'>
  <div class='red'></div>
</div>

.blue {
  position: relative;
}

.red {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
}

notE:
the .red div is gonna be positioned relative to the .blue so
it's top is in the 0th top position of the .blue element
