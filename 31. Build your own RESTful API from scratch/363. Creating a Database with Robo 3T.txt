363. Creating a Database with Robo 3T
=====================================

- you are gonna have a wikipedia on all of the programming knowledges that you learned 
- you're gonna have an article related to the topics that you've learned 
so you can have an article on the DOM, jquery, bootstrap, and you can 
have your own notes organized like this on our own wikipedia 

- the first thing we're gonna do:
create the data in our database 

- the GUI that is commonly used by mongodb:
robo 3T

you're gonna have to create a new database called 
wikiDB 

then create a collection called "articles"
