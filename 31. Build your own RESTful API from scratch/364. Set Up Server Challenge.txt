364. Set Up Server Challenge
============================

- after creating the database, now we're gonna create our server 

the boilerplate whenever you're creating a new server 
that uses mongodb:
1. create a new directory where you're gonna save your project in
2. initialize npm and install body-parser, mongoose, ejs, and express 
3. create a new file called app.js 
4. inside app.js add server code 
5. setup mongoDB:
- dbname is wikiDB
- collection name is articles
- document has 2 fields:
a. title
b. content
