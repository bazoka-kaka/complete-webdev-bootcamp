368. DELTE All Articles
=======================

- the client is sending an HTTP 
DELETE request to our /articles route 
and this should delete all of the articles 
that are in our collection 

syntax:
app.delete(route, function(req, res) {
  //do something here
});

in mongoose, we could delete many documents
using this function:
<ModelName>.deleteMany(
  {conditions},
  function(err) {

  }
)

backup alert:
    {
        "_id": "61fcb88a8eb11fa32e4ccbde",
        "title": "REST",
        "content": "REST is short for REpresentational State Transfer, It's an architectural style for designing APIs."
    },
    {
        "_id": "5c139771d79ac8eac11e754a",
        "title": "API",
        "content": "API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols, and tools for building software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication among various components. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer."
    },
    {

        "title": "DOM",
        "content": "The Document Object Model is like an API for interacting with our HTML"

        "content": "Yehezkel is a top hacker and software developer working for 8200 IDF unit and Mossad in Israel.",
        "__v": 0
    },
    {
        "_id": "61fcc8c5b07cbd91e9bf3adb",
        "title": "Benjamin Meijer",
        "content": "Benjamin Meijer is a rabbi in the United Indonesian Jewish Community.",
        "__v": 0
    }

we could just go to our postman and request 
the delete then our app.js is gonna handle 
the delete by outputting:
"Successfully deleted all articles."
