HOW TO BECOME A BETTER PROGRAMMER - CODE REFACTORING
====================================================

- as a programmer you wanna be DRY 
(Don't Repeat Yourself!)

don't be WET!
(We Enjoy Typing!)

WHY DO CODE REFACTORING?
------------------------
a. readability
so that other people or your future self can come back 
and understand your code 

b. modularity
how easy is it to reuse bits of codes and how easy is it 
to narrow down where your error is occuring (or another 
problems)

c. efficiency
how fast does your code run one of the example is using 
low level languages like c also the programming 
algorithm

d. length 
but don't make your code less readable!

code golf
---------
try to write the shortest code 
to achieve the same result (not a good practice!)
note:
this is not important at all!
