MEDIA QUERY BREAK POINTS
========================

google ranks your website on whether your website 
is mobile friendly or not 

you could do mobile friendly test here:
https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly

and just paste your website there 

you could do 2 things:
1. you can redirect your website if they are using mobile 
to another website that is for mobile phones 

2. you can make your website responsive
styles.css:
@media print {
  h1 {
    color: red;
  }
}

note:
here if we hit ctrl+p we are gonna see 
the h1 color turned to red 

another one:
@media screen {} --> this is gonna dependant on the 
screen size 

@media speech {} --> this is gonna work if the website
is being read to a visually imparied person 

MEDIA QUERY 
-----------
syntax:
@media <type> <feature>

another one:
@media (max-width: 900px) {
  //do something
}

note:
this is gonna be activated when the width is leess than 
or equals to 900px 

you can do this too:
@media (min-width: 900px) and (max-width: 1000px) {
  //do something
}

final code:
styles.css:
@media (max-width: 992px) {
  #title {
    text-align: center;
  }

  .title-image {
    position: static;
    transform: rotate(0);
  }
}

as a programmer you wanna do this:
DRY --> don't repeat yourself!
