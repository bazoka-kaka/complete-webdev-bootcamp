CSS Z-INDEX AND STACKING ORDER 
==============================

note:
the stacking order is the uppper one in html is gonna be in 
the back one in our view (further away from us)

example:
    <div class="red">RED</div>
    <div class="yellow">YELLOW</div>
    <div class="blue">BLUE</div>

the closest one to us is blue, the less closer one 
is yellow and the furthest one is red 

instead of changing the positioning using html, 
we can use css 

using something called z-index 

you can set z index as negative or positive 

note:
negative means further away, positive means closer to us 

- z-index is only working if your elements are positioned 
i.e absolute, fixed, and relative (not working for static)

example:
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 1px solid;
}

.red {
  background-color: red;
  position: absolute;
}

.yellow {
  background-color: yellow;
  z-index: 10;
}

this is not working because, the yellow is staticly 
positioned 

you can use the flowchart of the z-index when you 
find troubles

challenge:
make your phone hide behind the white one 

hints:
make the section below your phone's section background color 
white 

solution:
styles.css:
/* Image  */
.title-image {
  width: 60%;
  transform: rotate(25deg);
  position: absolute;
}

/* features  */
#features {
  text-align: center;
  padding: 7% 15%;
  position: relative;
  z-index: 10;
  background-color: white;
}

note:
don't change the title-image z-index to -1 it's gonna be 
in the back of the title section too!

don't change the position of #features to absolute!
it's gonna make it go out of the flow of the website 
therefore since the image is also absolute, it's gonna be 
top to the bottom html order (the top one will be the #features 
instead of the image!)

you can also do this:
styles.css:
/* Image  */
.title-image {
  width: 60%;
  transform: rotate(25deg);
  position: absolute;
}

/* features  */
#features {
  text-align: center;
  padding: 7% 15%;
  position: relative;
  background-color: white;
}

note:
notice that they both don't have z-index, therefore 
the one on top is gonna be the later one written in html 
if they both are positioned elements!

(see the flowchart)

ADD A LITTLE BIT OF PADDING ON THE BOTTOM 
OF THE TITLE SECTION 
------------------------------------------

styles.css:
.container-fluid {
  padding: 3% 15% 7%;
}

ALIGN THE IMAGE TO THE RIGHT TO THE END OF OUR MENU 
---------------------------------------------------

styles.css:
/* Image  */
.title-image {
  width: 60%;
  transform: rotate(25deg);
  position: absolute;
  right: 30%;
}
