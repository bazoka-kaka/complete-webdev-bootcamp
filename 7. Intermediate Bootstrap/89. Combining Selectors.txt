COMBINING SELECTORS 
===================

Multiple Selectors 
------------------

selector1, selector2, ... {}

example:
h1, p {
  color: red;
}

Hierarchical Selectors 
----------------------

example:
#title .container-fluid {
  padding-top: 3%;
  text-align: left;  
}

syntax:
parent child {}

Combined Selectors 
------------------

syntax:
selector1.selector2 {} --> html element combined with a class 
or
selector1#selector2 {} --> html element combined with an id 

note:
you shouldn't add any spacing between the selectors!

this is the opposite of the hierarchical selectors!

if you are a hierarchical selectors, then this is the syntax:
parent child {}

examlpe:
index.html:
<div class='container'>
  <h1 class='heading'>
    testing <span class='inner'>something</span>
  </h1>
</div>

styles.css:
//hierarchical selector
.container .heading {
  color: red;
}

//combined selectors 
div.container {
  color: black;
}

note:
div.container meaning that the div which has a class  
container should have the color black 

you can't do this:
div.inner {
  color: blue;
}

this is because currently you don't have any div 
which has a class called .inner
