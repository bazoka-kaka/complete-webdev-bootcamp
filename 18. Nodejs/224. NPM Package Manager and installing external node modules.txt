NPM PACKAGE MANAGER AND INSTALLING EXTERNAL NODE MODULES 
========================================================

- NPM (Node Package Manager)
note:
this is the world's largest collection of external 
node packages 

- why using a package manager?
instead of making something from scratch, 
you can add something that already is made!

also you can incorporate those packages into your own project!

- initializing npm 
> npm init 

and this is gonna create a file called "package.json"

- package.json
this is the description of all of our npm packages!

- installing our first module 
we're gonna install the superheroes module:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/superheroes

- installing superheroes:
> npm install superheroes 

note:
our package.json now has a dependency called 
superheroes!

{
  "name": "nodejs-testing",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "this is an intro to node project",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Yehezkel",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "superheroes": "^3.0.0"
  }
}

- implementing in our index.js:
var superheroes = require("superheroes");

const mySuperhero = superheroes.random();

console.log(mySuperhero);

challenge:
supervillains - npm package

after that you have to console log some supervillain names!

index.js:
const superheroes = require("superheroes");
const supervillains = require("supervillains");

const mySuperhero = superheroes.random();
const mySupervillain = supervillains.random();

console.log(mySuperhero);
console.log(mySupervillain);

inside of a dependency there are usually other dependencies 

this is like that has something inside of it all the time!
