WHAT IS NODEJS 
==============

- other backend apps:
a. php 
b. ruby
c. rails 
d. asp.net 
e. nodejs 
f. java 
g. python 

examples of websites using nodejs:
twitter, ebay, netflix, trello, uber 

- why nodejs?
node is real fast!

before using nodejs our javascript is locked behind 
the bar and we haven't make something beyond of it 

you haven't been able to have access to the file system,
the networking processes, etc 

good reason:
you don't wanna have a website created by a random person 
filled with malicious javascript codes!

but some cases you need access to the file system, 
for example if you are using something like atom 

bassically:
you need to be able to write code that can interact 
directly to the computer, independent of the browser!

that's the use of nodejs!

nodejs is gonna make javascript able to interact 
with the hardware of the computer 

atom is based on nodejs 

by using nodejs, we can create an application 
in the website, but also something that 
works within our local computer!

meaning:
you can program desktop application using nodejs

- what is the point by us making a local application?
we can use nodejs to run javascript code on server or someone else's computer 

google then will make a request to a google server and 
on those servers, we can execute javascript codes 
to process their requests! after that, we can send it back 
to the client!

VERY IMPORTANT 
--------------

all of those heavy lifting doesn't have to happen on the browser!
they are all (the logics etc) are gonna work on the local server!

meaning the speed is gonna be super fast!!!!!!
