USING NATIVE NODE MODULES 
=========================

nodejs documentation:
https://nodejs.org/en/docs/

- library to make nodejs able to get access 
with the local system directly:
the module is called the file system module
this is the link:
https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html

- to use the module, we have to require it:
const fs = require("fs");

- example of how to use this module:
1. create a file called test.txt 
2. write something to that file 
3. we're gonna use something called 
fs.copyFileSync(src, dest);

note:
this is gonna copy the file's content 

if you have anything inside of the destination 
file, everything that is inside of the destination 
file is gonna be replaced with everything 
that is inside the src file!

the final code:
index.js:
const fs = require("fs");
fs.copyFileSync("test.txt", "test1.txt");
