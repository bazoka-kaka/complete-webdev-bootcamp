CREATING OPENING AND REMOVING FILES USING BASH 
==============================================

- creating a new text file 
> touch newText.txt 

- opening a text file 
> open newText.txt 

note:
in windows: use start instead of open 

> start newText.txt 

- specifying which application that you wanna open your 
file with 
windows:
> start atom newFile.txt 

note:
the application used is atom, but you can also use another 
application 

on another OS:
> open -a atom newText.txt 

- deleting files inside the command line:
> rm newFile.txt 

- removing all the files inside a folder:
> rm *

- knowing in which directory you are currently in:
> pwd 

- remove folder 
> rm -r dirName/

note:
this is gonna delete everything inside the directory too!

sudo - Super User do 

sudo rm -rf something --> this is gonna force remove the directory 
without even asking!
