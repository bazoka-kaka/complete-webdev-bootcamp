UNDERSTANDING THE COMMAND LINE 
==============================

- kernel = the thing that is directly communicating 
with your hardware (the core of the operating system)

- shell = this is the User Interface (for common people 
interacting with the computer)

- there are 2 types of things in the shell:
1. the GUI shells 
2. the command line shells 

- BASH = Bourne Again Shell

- BASH shell is a cli or a command line intepreter 
for the UNIX system 

- UNIX based system are all over the place
example:
linux is a UNIX based system, lots of servers run on 
UNIX, even max os 10 

- the window uses something called DOS and windows 

- lots of things you can do using command line cna be done 
using GUI 

- why use command line?
greater control!
