BRANCHING AND MERGING 
=====================

- instead of continuing to commit into our master 
branch, we can create a side branch 
that is as many as we like 

- these little branches are things where 
we can do things without worrying about the main 
branch being broken 

- creating a branch:
> git branch [newBranchName]

- to see all the branches in your local repo:
> git branch 

- to go to another branch in yoru local repo:
> git checkout [branchName]

- merging with the master branch 
first goto the master branch 
> git checkout master 

then merge it with the branch that you wanna merge:
> git merge [branchName]

note:
this is gonna merge the master branch with 
another branch
