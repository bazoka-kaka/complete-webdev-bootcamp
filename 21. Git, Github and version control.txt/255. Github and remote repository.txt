GITHUB AND REMOTE REPOSITORIES 
==============================

- pushing commit into github:
a. creating a remote 
this is telling our local git repo that 
we've created a remote repo somewhere in
the internet and i wanna transfer all of my commits 
over there.
note:
origin is the name of the remote and you can call 
it anything you want but by convention and 
highly recommended that you use the keyword 
"origin"
> git remote add origin [your github repo url]

b. pushing to your remote github repo 
> git push -u origin master
note:
origin --> this is the name or remote 
master --> this is the name of branch 
which is the default branch or the main branch 
of all of your commits
