GITIGNORE 
========= 

- example if you have things like 
secret passwords, api keys, etc 
in a file called secret.txt 
that you don't wanna host in a 
public platform like github 

- another type of file that you wanna add 
to gitignore or you don't wanna upload to 
github:
files that are to do with your local settings,
user preferences, and there's a whole 
bunch of these types of utility files 
that you don't want another person 
to download and copy into their folders 

another common example:
.ds_store files which is bassically a settings 
file that saves things like how you like 
your icons to be arranged in a project folder 

this is a hidden file 

and we don't wanna clutter our github repo 
with that file 

- creating the .gitignore file:
> touch .gitignore 

you can add your files that should be ignored 
when we commit our project to git 

to remove all the files from the staging
area:
> git rm --cached -r .

- adding individual files to gitignore:
.DS_Store 
Secrets.txt 

- certain rules in .gitignore:
you can use the "#" to comment 
using wildcards:
example:
*.txt 

here means all of the files that have .txt 
as extension are gonna be ignored 

after that if you do this:
> git status 
the files that are visible are those 
that are not in the .gitignore
