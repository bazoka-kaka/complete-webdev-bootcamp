DEBUGGING CSS CODE 
==================

notes:
- we are gonna use chrome developer tools (this is why we use 
chrome here)
- if we open the chrome developer tool --> console, we're gonna
be able to find the error there
- the "/" in the linking makes the local relative 
to the root, while without the "/" it makes it relative
to the subdirectory that the index.html exists in 
or it's the same with something like this: "./"
