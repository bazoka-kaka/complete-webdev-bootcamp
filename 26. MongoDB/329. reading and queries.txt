MONGODB CRUD OPERATIONS IN SHELL: READING AND QUERIES
=====================================================

- show all of the collections in curr database:
>> show collections 

- show all of the documents that are inside 
a collections:
>> db.products.find()

note:
the collection name is products 

- querying specific elements only:
>> db.products.find({ name: "Pencil"})

note:
this is gonna output all the data 
that has the name "Pencil"

another example:
db.products.find({ price: { $gt: 1 } })

note:
this is gonna find all the products which 
has the price greater than 1

- querying that outputs projections (only 
the things that we wanna see)

>> db.products.find({_id: 1}, {name: 1})

note:
this is only gonna output the name of the product
that has an id of 1 

by default the id is also gonna be outputted 
therefore if we don't want our id 
to be outputted:
>> db.products.find({_id: 1}, {name: 1, _id: 0})
