MONGODB CRUD OPERATIONS IN SHELL: CREATE 
========================================

- whenever you are learning a new database, 
you have to learn how to perform CRUD 
using that database 

 - to create your server:
 > mongod 

- to open the mongo shell:
> mongo 
note:
you have to run mongod first to be able 
to do this 

in the shell
------------
- to show all the available options:
>> help 

- show database names:
>> show dbs 

- create a new database:
>> use shopDB

note:
if you do show dbs then you'll not 
see your new database there, this is because 
if you want your database to be listed, 
it has to have a content 

- to see what database you are currently in:
>> db

- create data using mongodb:
>> db.products.insertOne({_id: 1, name: "Pen", price: 1.20})

note:
you can choose to insertOne or insertMany

- show all the collections that exists 
in our current database:
>> show collections 

challenge:
create the second product as such:
id = 2
name = "Pencil"
price = 0.80
stock = 12
