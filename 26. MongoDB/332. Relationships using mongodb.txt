RELATIONSHIPS IN MONGODB 
========================

- 2 main ways of creating relationships 
using mongodb:
1. (preferred but depends on the model of data 
that you have) -- embedding document inside 
another document 

example:
db.products.insert(
  {
    _id: 3,
    name: "Rubber",
    price: 1.30,
    stock: 43,
    reviews: [
      {
        authorName: "Sally",
        rating: 5,
        review: "Best rubber ever!"
      }
    ]
  }
)

note:
the relationship is associated using the embedded 
document of reviews 

if we have another review for the same 
product, then we can append it to our array 

this embedding data is really good 
for one to many relationship

another example if one user could have many 
comments and one product could have many reviews 

challenge:
recreate the "Pencil" document that we deleted 
earlier then add in some reviews for that document 

this is the "Pencil document":
{
  _id: 2,
  name: "Pencil",
  price: 0.80,
  stock: 12,
  reviews: [
    {
      authorName: "Jake",
      rating: 4.5,
      review: "Best pencil ever"
    },
    {
      authorName: "Jane",
      rating: 4.7,
      review: "Amazing pencil"
    },
  ]
}

2. referencing another collection 
example:
collection review:
{
  authorName: "Jake",
  rating: 4.5,
  review: "Best pencil ever"
},
{
  authorName: "Jane",
  rating: 4.7,
  review: "Amazing pencil"
}

your reference:
{
  productNumber: 3243,
  reviews: [1, 2]
}
