WHAT IS HTML BOILERPLATE
========================

boilerplate is just the beginning html code looks like 
to do this in atom:
html + [enter]
! + [tab]
html  + [tab]
HTML:5 + [tab]

boilerplate = a code-template that we can reuse 

the most common keyboard shortcuts on atom:

what we're having now is html5

- the above boilerplate automation is something that we created
using emmet, we could find out more of these keys of emmet

2 things in an html code:
1. head
this tells the browser how it should handle the page.
there's title where you can set the name of the website

another thing is the meta
meta --> this gives you extra metadata or associated data to your html document 
if your meta data looks like this:
<meta charset="utf-8">
  
in this case we're telling our browser when the browser opens up the "utf-8"
file that all the text inside our webpage is encoded using UTF-8 encoding system

this is bassically all of the available characters that we can use inside our website
for it to be rendered correctly

mojibake --> (japanese meaning characters that are transformed) this is because
the browser is trying to render the characters using the wrong character set 
(meaning it's rendered incorrectly)

this is because at the same memory location, with different encoding system 
the character is also going to be different that's why sometimes it's gonna be 
a jumbled word

the standard encoding of your website is: utf-8 encoding 

this is because it includes all of those international symbols 
and in fact every single code that's in the unicode character set 

you can see all these here:
https://unicode-table.com/en/

the unicode also includes emojis 

the meta charset=utf-8 gives you the maximum chance of correctly rendering the 
browser that are from international visitors

other than the charset element, there're also different attributes that you might see
on different websites 

these are the most common ones:
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
  <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
  <meta name="author" content="John Doe">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>

these meta tags tall the browser how it should render or display the webpage 
they also give information to the search engine about the content of the website 
(real important so that your website shows up first on search engines)
