CREATING FIRST SERVER USING EXPRESS 
===================================

- first things first:
create a new file called server.js in a dir
then init the npm

- installing express 
docs:
http://expressjs.com/

installing:
http://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html#installing

to install:
> npm install express --save

note:
--save --> this is gonna add expressjs into your packages.json 
under the dependencies 

you don't have to add the "--save" manually anymore!

it's done by default!

so all you need to do is this:
> npm install express 

- requiring express 

hello world example:
http://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html#hello-world-example

note:
app --> this word is almost always gonna be used  
when you are referring to an express module!
(best practice)

server.js:
const express = require("express");

// a function that represents express module
const app = express();

//this listens on a specific port for any HTTP request
//that gets sent to our server
app.listen(3000);

note:
this is the barebone of the express server!

running the server:
> node server.js 

note:
this is not doing anything, it just is listening 
for a port!

- what is a port?
port is a channel that we tune our server to!

- if we wanna be able to see when our port is setup 
and when our server is running:
add a callback function in the .listen() function!

server.js:
const express = require("express");

// a function that represents express module
const app = express();

//this listens on a specific port for any HTTP request
//that gets sent to our server
app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log("server started on port 3000!");
});

- going to the actual server:
in your browser go to the webpage:
localhost:3000

note:
this is gonna show something like this:
Cannot GET /

this means:
when we start our browser to go to the server port 3000 
we're not able to get anything back!

- to get our server responds when a browser is making
a request to our server:
next!
