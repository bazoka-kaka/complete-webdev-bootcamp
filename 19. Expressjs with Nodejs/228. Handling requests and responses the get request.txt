HANDLING REQUESTS AND RESPONSES: THE GET REQUEST 
================================================

- earlier our server doesn't have anything to display!

- localhost:3000 is like the root (the homepage)
of any website 

example:
the root of google page is:
https://www.google.com

or localhost:3000/ means that it's in the homepage 
of our website!

when the server sees the request (localhost:3000) it's 
gonna send our browser a get response (html, css, and javascript)
that is needed to render the website that we want!

- making the server sends something back when our browser 
makes the get request:

app.get(location_of_get_request, callback_function)

note:
this is a method from express that specifies what 
should happen when a browser gets in touch with our server 
and makes a get request

example:
app.get("/", function (request, response) {
  //do something here
});

this is gonna define what should happen when 
someone makes a get request to the home route!

note:
route is just a more specific place in a port!

in the callback function:
request --> this is the request from the browser 

response --> this is the response that outcome server 
can make when the request gets triggered 
at certain location 

server.js:
const express = require("express");

// a function that represents express module
const app = express();

app.get("/", function (request, response) {
  response.send("Hello");
});

//this listens on a specific port for any HTTP request
//that gets sent to our server
app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log("server started on port 3000!");
});

note:
this is gonna output "Hello"

notice this:
app.get("/", function (request, response) {
  response.send("Hello");
});

we could even do something like this:
app.get("/", function (request, response) {
  response.send("<h1 style='color: red'>Hello World</h1>");
});

note:
this is gonna output the html code of 
<h1 style='color: red'>Hello World</h1>

like the usual html code output in your browser!


best practice:
app.get("/", function (req, res) {
  //do something
});
