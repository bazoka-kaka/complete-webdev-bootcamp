DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WEB APP AND STATIC WEB 
=========================================

- web application is not just a website anymore

- the static website:
browser makes request to the server --> server sends back 
the css, html, and javascript --> if there any javascript 
it'll get run in the client side (in the frontend)
therefore all the clients are gonna be able to see those processes 

and also this is gonna be real slow!

- the web application:
this is gonna make our website run serverside 

our browser makes a request to the server --> it's 
gonna execute the code and only deliver the outcome 
back to the user  (the user doesn't have to see all the logics)

we're gonna be able to interact with databases, queries, 
search, manipulate databases, more web applications
