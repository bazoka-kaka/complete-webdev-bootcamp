EXPRESS ROUTING PARAMETERS 
==========================

docs:
http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html

note:
read the route parameters part 

we're gonna go to a full page version 
of a blogpost here using the routing system 

you can do something like this:
app.get('/users/:userId/books/:bookId', function (req, res) {
  res.send(req.params)
})

note:
when the user enters something in the 
"userId" and "bookId" example:
/users/123/books/a

you're gonna be able to tap into that parameter 
that is stored in the userId and the bookId 


full example
------------

app.get("/news/:topic", function(req, res) {
  console.log(req.params.topic);
});

note:
how to access what the user typed after /news/
is using the req.params.[nameOfParameter]

then if the user type this:
*/news/politics

this is gonna output:
politics 

this is better than doing this:
app.get("/news/politics", function(req, res) {
  //do something here
});

app.get("/news/science", function(req, res) {
  //do something here 
});

...

which is redundant and is not effective
