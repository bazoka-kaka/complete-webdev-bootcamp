SETTING UP THE BLOG PROJECT
===========================

- the node module folder is ignored
by the .gitignore, therefore it doesn't 
get uploaded to github and you won't download 
it because it's such a big file 

- to install our dependencies in package.json:
> npm install 

note:
this is going to automatically go through 
package.json and install all the dependencies 
specified there
