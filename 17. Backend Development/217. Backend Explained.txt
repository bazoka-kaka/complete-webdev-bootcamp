BACKEND DEVELOPMENT
===================

- this consists of:
a. servers 
this serves your html, javascript, etc 

b. database 
this stores the user data (login, passwords)

c.Application 
this is where you create your business logic, how your web 
application work
example:
a. calculating flight price
b. making payment 

analogy:
restaurant -- client side (front end)
kitchen -- server 
larder -- database 

- you can't make your backend in your frontend part:
a. it's your business secret!
b. this is gonna make your website so slow, because you have
to load all the backend (because we are gonna show it 
to the user if you are taking it to the frontend!)

1. server creates the application 
2. the application is brought to the client-side 

examples of backend technologies:
a. php 
b. node.js 
c. java 
d. ruby 

examples of backend frameworks:
a. cakePHP 
b. ruby rails or spring
c. express 

the common one:
ruby and ruby on rails 

the main job of these technologies:
reduce the amount of repetitive stuffs 
that a developer has to do!

express is the nodejs's framework 

note:
nodejs runs on javascript
